# Algorithm-Grind

Repo mainly containing https://cses.fi and CodeForces problems along
with some of my own explaintations and notes for each module.
I even use clrs for few algorithms

This repo aims to be your go to place for learning a algorithms and also
practice a decent amount of problems for each module

Algorithms are written in C++
problems are solved in both C and C++


Module-1 this is another liner :
